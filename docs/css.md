# CSS

We recently removed sass from the boilerplate, and opted in several postcss plugins:
- postcss-import
- postcss-mixins [unused]
- postcss-simple-vars
- postcss-nested
- autoprefixer
- postcss-reporter


Please refer to [this](https://github.com/choonkending/react-webpack-node/issues/150) for more reading.

Note: This change to postcss is experimental, as there might be features you want from a preprocessor such as sass that might not be supported - unless you write a plugin yourself.

## CSS module questions

**How do I reuse a class?**
```css
/* Within the same file */
.borderLine {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
}

.actualClass {
  composes: borderLine;
}

/* From a different file */
.actualClass {
  composes: borderLine from './border.css';
}

```

**How do I reuse a value?**
```css
/* Within the same file */
@value color-white: #fff;

.actualClass {
  color: color-white;
}

/* From a different file */
@value color-white from './colors.css';
.actualClass {
  color: color-white;
}

```
