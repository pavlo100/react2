#### [TickTrade](http://ticktra.de)

Tick Trade was developed by [@caranicas](http://github.com/caranicas). It is a classified site for listing sports tickets. It uses Reddit as a log in authority with the goal of connecting fans with tickets to fans that want tickets without having to pay a third party like stub hub.
