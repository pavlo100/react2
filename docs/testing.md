Testing with:
- `karma` as test runner
	- `karma.conf.js` for the main karma configuration (it has webpack configurations)
	- `tests.webpack.js` which is the single entry file. It uses `webpack`'s require API to find all the files we need that have a `-test.js` suffix.
- `mocha` as the test framework
- `jsdom` as my test environment

```bash
# Run test once
npm test

# Run in watch mode
npm test:watch
```

We have unit tests for async (redux) actions, reducers, and components.
