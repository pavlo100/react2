1.2
======
- Breaking Changes (Apologize for the breaking changes):
  - react-router bumped up to react-router beta3
  - Deprecating UniversalRenderer:
    - Initially the server + client side code was very similar. But the code has evolved now and keeping them as one reusable class just complicates how the isomorphic (sorry, universal) react works.
    - Separating them now makes it easier to move forward.

1.1.7
======
- Renaming .react.js files into .jsx files. Now I feel like a weight has been lifted off my chest.
- Removing AnimationMixin (no longer in use and serves to be confusing)

1.1.6
======
- Breaking Changes:
   - `package.json` now has different commands to run servers locally. This was to fix an initial issue with sessions over HTTPS.
   - `npm run build && npm run dev` to run locally without a hot loader.
   - `npm run devHotLoader` to build and develop using react-hot-loader.
   - `npm run build && npm start` to run server for production (with HTTPS).

1.1.5
======
- [Css modules](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader#css-modules) that works with development and production setup

1.1.3
=======

- Added [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) for development speed
- Moved webpack config files into the /webpack folder

1.1.2
======

- Removed swig
- Parsing html files using webpack's html-loader, inspired by [react-starter](https://github.com/webpack/react-starter)
- Using react-helmet to manage favicons and links
- Renamed IsomorphicRouterRenderer to UniversalRenderer
- Removing views folder from server as we no longer need them
- Removing socket.io dependency as the examples no longer supports it

1.1.1
=======

- React Components in ES6
- Using babel-loader instead of jsx-loader

1.1.0
======

- Added ImmutableJS
- Using [alt](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt) and [iso](https://github.com/goatslacker/iso)
- isomorphic [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) on the client and server
- Structural changes:
	- Renamed:
  	1. SideSection.react -> Scoreboard.react
  	2. Header.react -> Entrybox.react
  	3. NavigationBar.react -> Navigation.react
		4. _navbar.scss -> navigation.scss
	- Removed:
		- AppDispatcher
		- Constants
		- InputFormField.react.js
- TopicStore to use alt's alt.createStore
- TopicActions to use alt's alt.createAction
- With alt, there won't need to be a dispatcher and constants
- Using webpack to build client and serverside bundles
- Removing `/** @jsx React.DOM */`
- Temporarily commented out AnimationMixin
